Hi! This is my repo tracking projects related to learning the Solidity programming language. To go direct to my contract code, [click here](https://github.com/CR-Mercado/mastering_ethereum/tree/main/remixbackup/.workspaces/default_workspace/contracts).

I'm taking [this Mastering Ethereum course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-ethereum-and-solidity-programming-with-real-world-apps) to develop my smart contract engineering and eventually launch my own contracts on the public [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) blockchain.

If you're new to blockchain, you can get a free copy of my book [Blockchain Thoughts & DeFi Economics](https://leanpub.com/blockchainthoughts) by sliding the price to $0.

If you're interested in more advanced writings on Ethereum, Decentralized Finance, Data Science, and Economics you can follow my substack here: [charliemarketplace.substack.com](https://charliemarketplace.substack.com)

Thank you for checking out my repo / github!
