 This is an abstract of the custom FAIR lottery I am designing.
 
 - 1 ETH per lottery ticket - accepts but ignores smaller entrances; no benefit for oversends
 - Lottery is managed by a smart contract that deploys/controls the lottery
 - contract transfers 90% of the balance to the winner's address; 9% to the manager; 1% split among each unique entrant
 - lottery tracks the unique entrants for splitting a separate reward
 - lottery is then reset
